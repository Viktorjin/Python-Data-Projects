In this project we're going to apply Naive Bayes algorithm by building a spam filter for SMS messages. Our goal is to create a program to classifies new messages with accuracy of greater than 80%. To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo from UCI Machiine Learning Repository. The data collection process is described in details on this page.
